Simple API using NodeJS, Express, and PostGres with the help of Typescript and Docker.

For Typescript and Docker Setup I followed this tutorial: https://dev.to/chandrapantachhetri/docker-postgres-node-typescript-setup-47db

For setting up the todo database: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-pern-stack-full-course/

Specification:
```
